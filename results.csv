Stand out from the crowd when you relocate your business to this high-profile corner plot in the heart of downtown Ottawa. This 23-story high-rise with no less than seven elevators and extensive secure underground parking has views across Parliament Hill which never fail to impress. Meanwhile, a double-story shared lobby floods this communal area with light, delivering the wow factor to your clients and guests from the moment they step inside.

In this multi-tenanted building, you'll be rubbing shoulders with major players from a range of industries, chatting over a coffee or at the water cooler, while the building’s redesign to incorporate numerous communal areas and meeting rooms makes coworking a breeze. Five full floors of accommodation are available on levels two to six, as well as some of the ground floor – that’s almost 7,000 square metres in total. Just a few short steps away from planned LRT stations scheduled to start running in 2019, it couldn’t be better located, while virtual office solutions are also available on request.  

At Spaces Spaces Laurier, we can support with:     
• Office Space: Your own private and fully serviced office space with a flexible contract that adapts to your business and is accessible 24/7.      
• Coworking Membership: Work from thousands of coworking spaces worldwide, all with a flexible contract and unlimited access during business hours.     
• Dedicated Desk: Your own private desk in a shared office or open plan space that can be accessed 24/7, locker included, all with a flexible contract.      
• Meeting Rooms: Choose from thousands of on-demand meeting rooms and event spaces with all the services you need, fully customisable to any event or duration.      
• Virtual Office: Leave the best impression with a professional business address at one of our locations and have us handle your calls and mail.
